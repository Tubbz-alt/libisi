libisi is a library implementing the PhoNet (Phone Network Protocol),
which has been invented by Nokia. PhoNet is available on Linux with
the PhoNet socket family. The library is called libisi instead of
libphonet, because phonet is just a specification for the abstract
packages. ISI (Intelligent service interface) is the specific
implementation used on the Nokia N900 (and some other phones).

Apart from the library this repository contains a wireshark plugin,
which decodes the ISI binary protocol.
